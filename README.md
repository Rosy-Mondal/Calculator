Calculator
This project is a basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator provides essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a clean and responsive user interface, with buttons for numbers, operations, and a display that shows the current input and result. The JavaScript code handles input processing, operation selection, and calculation logic, making it a practical example of fundamental frontend development skills like DOM manipulation and event handling.
